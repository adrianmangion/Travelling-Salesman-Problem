# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
CST 3170 - Artificial Intelligence Coursework

Coursework Brief:

The coursework is to build a system in Java that solves travelling salesman problems. The travelling salesman problem is to go to each city exactly once and return to the start. Solving the problem should give a path and the length of the path. There are optimal solutions, that is solutions with the shortest path.

Sample files are provided below. They have n lines for n cities. The first integer in the line is the city number (starting with 1 and ending with n) and the second and third integers are the X and Y coordinates of the city. Distance is standard Euclidean distance.

The code should be written entirely by the student. You are entirely welcome to discuss the project with others, but you need to write every single character. If you use an algorithm described elsewhere, please include a reference to that in the report.

The system should be run on the training TSPs, and submitted by 5 pm on 10th. At 5 pm, the test TSPs will be released. The student should run their unmodified system on the tests, gather the results and submit the final project. This should be submitted by 5:00 pm on December 11th to myunihub.
